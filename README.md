# Terraform-azure-vm
This is the approach of creating azure vm through service principle
I have made the main file, instance file and network file different to make it more understable.

make sure to download the terraform in your system and also make sure that you are logged in azure cli

terraform fmt = this is used to coorect the code structure/indentations in the code.
terraform validate = to check the code is valid or not.
terraform plan = to check what resouces are going to be created with this terraform file.
terraform apply -auto-approve = this is used to create the resources with the help of the terraform file and auto approve will approve the permissions.
